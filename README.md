## Goal
> Be in a position to own space infrastructure
> > **Point of attack**: Building 

## Purpose of this document
1. See more connections in real-world information that can spur action (See appendix 2).
> I feel like this is the actual "thing" I should be focusing on building.
 
## Scope
> Factors
>> 1. Attack a component used by the space industry.
>> 2. Psychological needs (See Appendix 1)<br>
>
> Answer
> >Hardware and design.



### Criteria:
1. Flexibility, I can create anything
2. I can reach it.

### Concrete tech projects
1. Interactive animation that pinpoints location of coffee exchanges all over the world.
    - x
2. Coffee delivery drone system. 
3. The infrastructure supporting AI Chatbots
    
### Exploratory
- How to create my own hardware?
    1. Lets start with what I have observed. Breadboard, wires, 
- How is mathematics actually used (Concretely) in development of robotics and space infrastructure?

## Appendix
**Appendix 1**: Control over the environment (being able to change it)
> **Event**: COVID-19 lockdown in a specific environment triggered helpless army experiences.<br>
> **Concrete solution**: Target the environment by changing the stuff in the environment using hardware and design.

**Appendix 2**: How does linking pieces of information help you in guiding your projects?
> **Examples**:
> 
> > PwC audience with CHRO: Mckinsey likes to hire candidates from top companies in specific areas, Mckinsey likes to network with top-level people in companies, I am in a room full of executives, question is about why did I come to PwC. Possibility is that I can get an audience with someone who can get me in. I answered (Goal, factor, action). Got an audience.

> > 2.5k profit: Markets tend to crash extremely hard during huge and negative economic events, but then bounce back afterwards. COVID-19 lockdown seems to fit that "huge negative economic event". Observed the markets, I was right. Now is the opportunity to buy.

> > Obtaining Cartrack internship: I want to join the space industry. X.com, I saw this post about Lumen orbit by Ycombinator (data center in space). Wonder how to get into the data center business. Random lookup and find article of [NTU high performance computing team](https://ntuhpc.org/). There is an indication that they have sysadmin on the team. Recognised that my personal web hosting project on raspberry pi is somewhat related to sysadmin. Googled sysadmin internship. Found cartrack. Wrote the problems I faced and how I solved them. Go the interview and got accepted.
